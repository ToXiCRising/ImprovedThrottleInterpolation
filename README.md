# Improved throttle interpolation

## Background
After being recommended a video by [Niels Heusinkveld](https://youtu.be/0gW-cbSX3Uc) discussing the non-realistic torque interpolation used in many modern racing sims, I tried to write a quick script that generates a more realistic interpolation.

## Results
Many modern day sims seems to use a linear interpolation between a full throttle curve and a zero throttle curve, that simulates the engine inertia.

This results in throttle curves as seen in the following diagram:

Using a scaled smoothstep we are able to generate following torque curves:

The script uses a full throttle torque curve ripped from the RSS Protech P91 Mod for Assetto Corsa and a linear zero throttle curve.

## Method
I use the throttle input to generate a new rpm-based input curve.
The input percentage controls the position and width of a smoothstep-function along the rpm-band. This results in the curves following the full throttle curve for a certain time. Afterwards they smoothly fall off.
To generate more pleasing curves for low rpm, low throttle situations, the smoothstep gets scaled linearly until a throttle of 40 percent is reached. Thus resulting in a more "realistic" torque-curve behaviour.

## Usage and dependencies
This script can either be run standalone, this will create the diagram seen in Results.
Alternatively you can run the script in VSCode as a Jupyter Notebook, which will result in an interactive diagram.

The script uses matplotlib for plotting and ipywidgets for the interactive notebook-plot.
